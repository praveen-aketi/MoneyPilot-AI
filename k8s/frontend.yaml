              value: "http://backend:4000" # NOTE: In a real K8s setup, this needs to be the public URL of the backend or handled via ingress/proxy because Next.js runs client-side sometimes. For 'standalone' + server components, internal DNS might work for SSR, but for client fetches, it needs a public route.
            # Simplified for now assuming SSR or internal routing availability.
